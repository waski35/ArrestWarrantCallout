Arrest Warrant Callout for LSPDFR extends Your game experience by :

 -  arrest warrant callout for various criminals including various reasons (murder, assault, robbery, rape etc.),
 -  prison escape callout (2 various suspects with variable models, usually armed, sometimes heavy armed, using variable       car models, escaping to variable location) where player have to locate escaping criminals - there is only some 	    area known where they are, and this area is from time to time updated with notification from control,
 -  show player area to serch for wanted criminal near felon’s home, or en-route, or supposed hideout, 
 -  criminal sometimes waits for Police unaware of arrest warrant, sometimes is fleeing (in such case player will have to      locate – car, or person on foot) to seaport, airport, or he/she is hiding in mountains
 -  criminal is sometimes armed, sometimes not, sometimes he/she will be heavy armed and considered dangerous – player     will be notified about severity of arrest warrant, but there’s some probability of incorrect intel,
 -  sometimes criminal will try to fight with player, sometimes he will try to escape, and sometimes if injured he will     surrender, depending on current situation – I have put some logic for this inside callout besides this what we have in     LSPDFR.
 -  dead criminal is best dealt with FinKone’s coroner van
 -  arrested criminal can be transported with transport van (from Albo’s modification)

This mod has more than 24 possible random variations of how it goes (given above random conditions), which all count as single callout.
